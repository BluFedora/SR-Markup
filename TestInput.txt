@h3 { Introduction }

@Text(Size = "Full") {
  Project: Gemini is a two player co-op platformer where you Jump, Dash, Shoot and Smash through enemy drones.
  You play as either Guttierez (Gutz) or Cricket in an attempt to stop the evil corporation from taking over the city.
  In this cyberpunk-esque level you will encounter turrets, barbed wire, and other road blocks, but don't worry we have checkpoints!
  Me and a team of 11 other people made this game in our Sophomore year at <b>DigiPen</b> over the course of a year.

@h3 { Demos }

@h3 { 2D Rigidbody Physics System }

@video(Size = "Half", Src = "data/post-data/07/demo_physics.mp4")

@Text(Size = "Half") {
  This is the physics engine in action showing support for circles and arbitrary convex polygons.
}


@h3 { In-Game Level Editor }

@image(Size = "Half", Src = "data/post-data/07/demo_editor_00.PNG")

@Text(Size = "Half") {
  This editor was the tool we used author content for the game such as asset management and level creation.
  It sports debug draw, a profiler, checking the current status of connected controllers, changing graphics settings such as bloom, and editing of physic collision geometry.
  To open the editor all you have to do is press the tilde key ('~') and it will run the editor on top of the game.
}

@h3 { Serialization and Prefabs }

@video(Size = "Half", Src = "data/post-data/07/demo_prefabs.mp4")

@Text(Size = "Half") {
  This is a demo of the prefab system, you can make object types in the editor and later use that template for easier level creation.
  If you edit the prefab then the changes will propagate to all instances of the prefab.
}
